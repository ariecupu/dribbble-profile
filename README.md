DribbbleProfile
===============

DribbbleProfile is a web module that showcases Dribbble player's profile together with his/her last shot.


I made this as a debut shot on Dribbble to give something valuable for all Dribbble players and to thank Dave Rocks for his invite.

This ready-to-use module features:

- Your name
- Location
- Profile photo
- Number of your shots at dribbble
- Overall number of Likes you received
- Number of your followers
- As well as your last shot (clickable)

You can insert it in any page on your website to showcase your up-to-date profile.

Try the [live demo](http://js.ework.me/code/dribbble-profile/) with your own dribbble profile.

Have fun! :)
