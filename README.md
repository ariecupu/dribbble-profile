DribbbleProfile
===============

DribbbleProfile is a web module that showcases Dribbble player's profile together with his/her last shot.

Enter your Dribbble username [here](http://js.ework.me/code/dribbble-profile/) to see how it will look like with your own profile.

You can insert it in any page on your website to showcase your up-to-date profile. Here is [live demo](http://js.ework.me/about/) on Wordpress page.
